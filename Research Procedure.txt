This is the procedure I will be following to collect all of the data from the LLMs and Leetcode. This is bound to change based on if I can find a way to automate this.


1. Create new accounts for Leetcode and all of the AIs we will be using for research. Make it clear on Leetcode that the solutions are AI generated.
2. Collect a sample of 15 Leetcode problems in the Easy, Medium, and Hard categories. Collect them by copy and paste them into a table.
3. Paste a question into a new chat for GPT-3.5, Gemini, Perplexity AI, and Claude. It should give a set of code to use.
4. Using the code the AI provides, paste it into Leetcode and run it to see if it accomplishes all of the tasks and test cases. 
      - If it passes all requirements:
          - Collect information on runtime and memory.(Collect in ms and mb / how well it performed in those categories compared to other users)
          - Collect information on the amount of lines of code(excluding comments and empty lines)
      - If it does not pass all requirements:
          - Collect data on each attempt of the AI to fix it
          - Errors that came at each attempt to solve the problem
          - Copy and paste error messages and collect somewhere to catalog common errors produced by AI.
          - Which tasks it was unable to complete (Only the first one etc.)
      - To get a new answer from the AI use this prompt:
          - The code above is not correct. Here are the test cases and what is being returned by the code:
              - Test case 1: 
                - Input - ___ 
                - Output - ___
                - Expected - ___
              - Test case 2: 
                - Input - ___ 
                - Output - ___
                - Expected - ___
              - Test case 3: 
                - Input - ___ 
                - Output - ___
                - Expected - ___
